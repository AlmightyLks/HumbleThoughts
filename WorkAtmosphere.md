## Desire & Expectation At The Workspace

---

> The formula is simpler for me.  
> I am married with kids so it's pretty concrete that every time I say "yes" to work I have to say "no" to my wife and/or kids.  
> I don't "work to live" though I still "live to work" lol.  It's what I enjoy and I wouldn't retire if I didn't have to work.
> 
> That being said, when I am not enthusiastic about some task I can find it hard to work on the task.  
> No amount of management has helped with that.  
> It doesn't matter if I have a micro-manager riding me or a hands off manager that gives me a ton of freedom.  
> My motivation has to come from the job.  
> The only way I force myself to stay efficient and power through the boring tasks is to focus on the motivation of the larger task.
> 
> I've worked on teams where everyone "cares" and is stressed about getting the task done and I've worked on teams where nobody cares and everyone is just punching in the hours.  
> I can't say either one has had an effect on how much work I get done.  
> However, if I'm working on a team where people are passionate about the project then just talking with them can renew my passion for the project and get me to go back to the tasks I didn't want to do.
