## Team Contribution, Not Team Construction

> WRONG! Both are engineers! Both COULD do each others work, as long as the competency allows it. In the end, it is not about individual contribution but a team as a whole. If you, as a dev, think that you can prove stuff works in upper environments and can do it fast, if you can do the perf testing- go for it. And you, as a tester, if you understand programming- please be involved in code reviews, please fix a bug if you know exactly what's wrong and can do it fast.

> A long time ago (>10 years) I used to think that testers get the program and click through it, by hand, to trigger unexpected behaviour;  
> This is obviously not the case, or at the very least, not anymore. There is automation involved, and the tester will likely know at least programming language, so there is an overlap, and the tester could move to a programming position, and vice versa, if they learn the stuff of the other.
